# ðŸ‘œ 0/1 Knapsack Problem (Dynamic Programming)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements the **0/1 Knapsack Problem** using **Dynamic Programming (DP)** in Python.  
The 0/1 Knapsack is a classic optimization problem in computer science, where the goal is to **maximize the total value** in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.
